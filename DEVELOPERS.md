### Local setup

   git clone git@github.com:marcdonald/vimarily.git
   ```
2. Open `Vimarily.xcodeproj` with Xcode.
3. [Set your signing team](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev23aab79b4) for both targets (Vimarily and Vimarily Extension).

You might have to reload the website you had open for the changes to take effect. Also check your configuration file as it currently does not get upgraded automatically.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the development of Vimarily you can help us out through several means:

1. Create bug reports for issues you encounter, or look trough existing bug reports and try to reproduce their problems.
2. Try out the latest beta version (if there is one) and report issues back to us.
3. Contribute ideas, if you'd like something to be added to Vimarily you can create an issue describing exactly what you have in mind. Together we can help form the idea and get it into Vimarily.
4. Contribute code, if you find a bug or issue that you think you can help us solve you are more than welcome to do so.

### Contributing Code

If you want to contribute to Vimarily through coding you have to start by selecting an issue to work on. If you'd like to contribute something new, make an issue first to discuss the idea.

You can fork the Vimarily source code and make the changes to implement your feature or solve a bug. Once finished you can create a pull request back into the Vimarily repository where it can be reviewed.

After a successful review your code will be merged with the master branch and released to Vimarily users in the next release. Pretty cool!
